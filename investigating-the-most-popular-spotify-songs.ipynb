If you want to create a song and want it to be the most popular possible, here are some guidelines you should follow to maximize your chances of success : \n\n* **Key** : As we've seen throughout the analysis, the C# key is the most popular and most successful one for listeners.\n* **Mode** : Using the Major mode is preferable, as it is the most popular and most successful mode on Spotify.\n* **BPM** : A rythm above the heart rate, but not too fast, is recommended. The range should be between 90 BPM and 120 BPM.\n* **Energy** : Your song needs to share a minimum of energy to be among the most popular ones. A minimum of 40% is recommended.\n* **Danceability** : The more danceable it is, the best it will perform. \n* **Valence** : Positivity is the key, be positive in the song and it will have a higher chance of success.\n* **Acousticness** : Lower the acousticness of the song, as highly acoustic songs do not perform that well.\n* **Instrumentalness** : Do not put any instrumentalness at all if possible.\n* **Liveness** : A low percentage of liveness tends to perform better so don't put too much of it. 7% to 14% should be enough.\n* **Speechiness** : Just like liveness, a low percentage of speechiness is acceptable with 3% to 9% being a good range.\n* **Playlists Presence** : The most important thing is the presence of the song in playlists throughout all the streaming platforms because it will boost the popularity of your song exponentially.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **📝 Note of the Author**\n\nFirstly, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to all of you who took the time to read this notebook.
